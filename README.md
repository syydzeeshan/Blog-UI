# Blog Post Website

This website allows you to create blog posts with a title, author name, category and body. It also includes validations to ensure that the data you enter is valid.

## Validations

The website includes the following validations:

    Title length: The title must be between 5 and 100 characters.
    Author name length: The author name must be between 5 and 30 characters.
    Body length: The body must be between 10 and 2000 characters.
    If any of these validations fail, you will see an error message indicating what went wrong.
