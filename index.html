          <p class="blog-post-meta">January 1, 2023 by <a href="#">Mark</a></p>
          <p>This blog post shows a few different types of content that's supported and styled with Bootstrap. Basic typography, lists, tables, images, code, and more are all supported as expected.</p>

          <p>This is some additional paragraph placeholder content. It has been written to fill the available space and show how a longer snippet of text affects the surrounding content. We'll repeat it often to keep the demonstration flowing, so be on the lookout for this exact same string of text.</p>
          <h2>Blockquotes</h2>
          <p>This is an example blockquote in action:</p>
          <blockquote class="blockquote">
            <p>Quoted text goes here.</p>

          <h3>Example lists</h3>
          <p>This is some additional paragraph placeholder content. It's a slightly shorter version of the other highly repetitive body text used throughout. This is an example unordered list:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>First list item</li>
            <li>Second list item with a longer description</li>

          <h3>How to Avoid Object Mutation in JavaScript</h3>
          
          <p class="blog-post-meta">January 1, 2023 by <a href="#">Zeeshan</a></p>
          <p>1. Create a New Object

          This may seem obvious, but you can always create a new object! It may be a few more lines of code, but this way, you avoid the headaches later on when you need to change an object and have multiple variables pointing to the same one within memory. With our object, we can even use the value stored at character.firstName for the new Object avenger points to.</p>

          <p>Mutable objects, and mutation, don’t have to be feared. It can get tricky, but all in all, there are many different ways to avoid mutating objects. I hope this was helpful, and let me know if you think of any other ways to avoid mutation.</p>
          <p>Lorem ipsum, or lipsum as it is sometimes known, is dummy text used in laying out print, graphic or web designs. The passage is attributed to an unknown typesetter in the 15th century who is thought to have scrambled parts of Cicero's De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum for use in a type specimen book. It usually begins wi</p>
          <p>The passage experienced a surge in popularity during the 1960s when Letraset used it on their dry-transfer sheets, and again during the 90s as desktop publishers bundled the text with their software. Today it's seen all around the web; on templates, websites, and stock designs. Use our generator to get your own, or read on for the authoritative history of lorem ipsum.
